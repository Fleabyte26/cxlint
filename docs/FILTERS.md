# Linter Filters Reference
This section covers all of the available input filters for use with the Linter and includes some sample usage.  

| Filter Name  | Description  | Usage  | 
|---|---|---|
| agent_type | A string, one  of  `voice` or `chat`. Some linter rules are only applicable to voice agents (i.e. DTMF rules, SSML rules, etc.). To disable these checks, simply set your agent_type to chat instead.  | `agent_type=”chat”`  |
| intent_include_pattern  | A string pattern that filters the Intent by its Display Name. The Intent Display Name is checked to see if it includes the provided pattern. If there is a match, it will be linted.  | `intent_include_pattern=”head.”`  |
| intent_exclude_pattern  | A string pattern that filters the Intent by its Display Name. The Intent Display Name is checked to see if it includes the provided pattern. If there is a match, it will NOT be linted.  | `intent_exclude_pattern=”supp”`  |
| flow_include_list | A List of Flow Display Names to include for linting. If the Flow Display Name is present in the list, it will be linted. If `flow_include_list` is used, it will inherently exclude any Flow that is NOT in the include list. This filter is best used when you only want the linter to run on a few specific Flows. Ex: If you have 20 Flows in your agent, and you add “Default Start Flow” to the include list, all other 19 Flows will inherently be excluded from linting. | `flow_include_list[“Default Start Flow”, “My Cool Flow”]` |
| flow_exclude_list|A List of Flow Display Names to exclude for linting. If the Flow Display Name is present in the list, it will NOT be linted. If flow_exclude_list is used, it will inherently include any Flow that is NOT in the exclude list. This filter is best used when you only want to exclude a few specific Flows. Ex: If you have 20 Flows in your agent, and you add “Default Start Flow” to the exclude list, all other 19 Flows will be linted. | `flow_exclude_list[“Default Start Flow”, “Really Big Flow”]` |
|language_code |This filter accepts a String or a List of Strings, where each String represents a language_code configured in the CX Agent.| `language_code=['en', 'es']` |
| resource_filter | This filter accepts a List of Strings, where each element in the list corresponds to a resource type name. The available list of resources types are as follows: `flows`, `intents`, `entity_types`, `test_cases`, `webhooks`. This filter is best used when you only want the linter to run over a specific set of resources. Ex: If you add `flows` and `intents` to the `resource_filter` list, only these two resource types will be linted. All other resource types will be inherently excluded.| `resource_filter=['flows', 'intents', 'webhooks']`|
| test_case_pattern | This will filter Test Cases by Display Name where the provided pattern exists inside the Display Name. Ex: If you provide the pattern `SA`, the following Test Cases would be matched: `SA1.Dev`, `SA2.Dev`, `TXSA123`. This filter is best used when you have a large set of Test Cases, but only care to lint a subset of the Test Cases and choose to filter them by name. This can also be used in conjunction with `test_case_tags` filter to provide multiple levels of Test Case filtering. | `test_case_pattern=SA` |
| test_case_tags | This filter accepts a String or List of Strings. The string, or string elements of the list, should correspond to Test Case `tags` that exist in your set of Test Cases. Ex: If you provide the tags `['#required', '#development']`, any Test Case that contains these tags will be linted. All others will inherently be excluded. | `test_case_tags=['#required', '#prod']` |
